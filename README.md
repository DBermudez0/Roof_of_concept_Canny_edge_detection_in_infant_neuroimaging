# Proof_of_concept_Canny_edge_detection_in_infant_neuroimaging
Test to see how well Canny edge detection works with infant neuroimaging data

<p> Since, to the best of my knowledge no body has tested how Canny edge detection works on infant neuroimaging datasets. I have decided to investigate how good is Canny edge detection is at characterizing edges in infant's brain images from a single slice for an infant that is 0 months and 3 months old. I hope this little proof of concept helps in the development of neuroimaging toolboxes to enable one to analysis neuroimaging datesets from infants. </p>
